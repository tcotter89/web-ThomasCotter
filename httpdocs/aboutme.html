				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<br />
				<div class="text">
					<p>I was born in Dallas, Texas and raised in the North Texas area. From an early age I showed an affinity for logic games, always wanting to be solving another puzzle. This, combined with the artistic talent that runs and is encouraged in the family led me to a field that could combine the two - web design, specifically emphasizing User Interfaces and User Experience.</p>
					<br />
					<p>I focused mainly on my art talent through High School, with little opportunity to sharpen my logic skills outside of normal class assignments. After High School I turned my attention towards my drive to solve logic puzzles and decided to pursue a Bachelor's Degree of Computer Science. This was a great success for me, challenging my brain to dive into and solve the deepest puzzles I could find. Half way through I took an internship working at a small web design company, creating DotNetNuke websites for various clients. I worked for this company for roughly two years, honing my skills and pursuing my passion.</p>
					<br />
					<p>After what felt like a blink my undergraduate studies were coming to a close, four years of training and it simply wasn't enough. I needed to have more. I turned my eyes towards furthering my education, specifically a Master's degree of Computer Science. Another two years passed and I found myself with enough schooling to satisfy my drive for now - it was time to enter the working world</p>
					<br />
					<p>At this point I had done three different internships, giving me exposure to different aspects of Computer Science that I could focus on. I decided to go towards the consulting field for now. I think this was the best fit for me because I had very diverse skills at this point and the multiple projects that consultants go between is an appealing way to learn even more angles of Computer Science and to help myself find exactly where I excel the most.</p>
					<br />
					<p>Working with my two best skills - my artistic talent and my logical reasoning, I found myself to be unusually skilled at User Interfaces and the User Experience field. Finding how to use these two very opposite skills together was difficult but rewarding.</p>
